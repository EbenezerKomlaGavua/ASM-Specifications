CoreASM VmpoolJobInit

/**
*ASSUMPTIONS:
*This is algorithm models the Vm Pooling Job Initializing algorithm of the ASM model.
*The algorithm utilizes universes,Agents,signatures,functions
* and derived funtions in the modeling process.
*The algorithm is expected to have generated jobs, existing vms,engaged processes 
*and supplied resources  available before the modelling commences.
* The job required initialization functions must be active. 
* A joblauncher function created with which maps the jobhandler to a vms Jobhandler is 
*expected to be mapped to ensure that job processing can be achieved.
*When all the above holds; The systemstate function (which includes the JobState,
*Jobtime and the ProcessState) must be mapped to active.
