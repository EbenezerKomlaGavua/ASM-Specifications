# OVERVIEW
This package contains files of CoreASM Specifications designed for an Abstract State Machine(ASM) Model for Auto-Scaling Mechanisms. The ASM model was designed with Auto-Scaling Mechanisms developed on the DIScrete event baSed Energy Consumption simulaTor for Clouds and Federations (DISSECT-CF). 


## CATEGORIES OF FILES
 There are four main categories of files in this package. The core modules, the job initialization files, the job queuing files, the job handling files. There are Six Auto-Scaling Mechanisms(Auto-Scalers) described in this package. These auto-scalers are sub-divided into the four categories mentioned above. 

#### CORE MODULES FILES
These files make up the core files required for the applying the ASM model to any auto-scaler. There core modules for job initialization, job queuing and job handling. There are also core modules for jobhandling vm requests and other specific functions.
#### JOB INITIALIZATION FILES

#### JOB QUEUING FILES

#### JOB HANDLING FILES

###### OTHER AUTO-SCALING MECHANISMS
